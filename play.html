            MRS. POPOV. [_Springing up._] What? What do you mean by saying such
            things to me? <br>

            SMIRNOV. You have buried yourself alive, but meanwhile you have not
            forgotten to powder your nose! <br>

            MRS. POPOV. How dare you speak so? <br>

            SMIRNOV. Don't scream at me, please; I'm not the manager. Allow me to
            call things by their right names. I am not a woman, and I am accustomed
            to speak out what I think. So please don't scream. <br>

            MRS. POPOV. I'm not screaming. It is you who are screaming. Please leave
            me, I beg of you. <br>
            SMIRNOV. Pay me my money and I'll leave. <br>

            MRS. POPOV. I won't give you the money. <br>

            SMIRNOV. You won't? You won't give me my money? <br>
