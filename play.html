            <h5>MRS. POPOV.</h5> 
            <p>[_Springing up._]</p> What? What do you mean by saying such things to me?</p>
            

           <p><h5> SMIRNOV.</h5> You have buried yourself alive, but meanwhile you have not
            forgotten to powder your nose!</p> 

          <p>  <h5>MRS. POPOV.</h5> How dare you speak so?</p>

           <p><h5>SMIRNOV.</h5> Don't scream at me, please; I'm not the manager. Allow me to
            call things by their right names. I am not a woman, and I am accustomed
            to speak out what I think. So please don't scream.</p>  

            <p><h5>MRS. POPOV.</h5> I'm not screaming. It is you who are screaming. Please leave
                me, I beg of you.</p> 
            <p><h5>SMIRNOV. </h5>Pay me my money and I'll leave.</p> 

            <p><h5>MRS. POPOV. </h5>I won't give you the money.</p>

            <p><h5>SMIRNOV.</h5> You won't? You won't give me my money? </p>
